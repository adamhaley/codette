# Codette

**Codette** is a declarative web design system and template library that empowers creative developers to define websites using structured markdown and minimal boilerplate. Designed for AI code assistants, Codette translates human-friendly design intent into clean, responsive HTML/CSS/JS code.

## ✨ What is Codette?

Codette is a developer-centric tool for rapidly prototyping and generating elegant brochure-style websites. Think of it as a **design prompt language** paired with a curated **starter codebase** — an intersection of:

- ✍️ Markdown-like declarations
- 🧠 AI-assisted code generation (Claude, Gemini CLI, Cursor, etc.)
- 🧩 Reusable, aesthetic components
- 📐 Best practices in responsive HTML/CSS (no frameworks required)

Codette lets you work *with* your AI assistant instead of constantly fighting boilerplate. One file defines your intent — layout, palette, components, tone — and Codette brings it to life.
